Update program structure so:
		- Move syntaxChecker() to Chess object
		- Add a public state variable to Chess object to denote what kind of input it's looking for
		- Reader gets removed
		- GameRunner becomes a full controller object
		- Printer becomes a full View object
		- 

Look into being able to remove the .dead attribute from Piece objs
